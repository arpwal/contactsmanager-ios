## Features

- Comprehensive contact management
- Business-focused contact organization
- iOS 17+ support
- Swift 5.5+ compatibility

## Social Features

ContactsManager SDK enables you to build engaging social experiences in your application while maintaining complete privacy and security for your users' contact data:

- **Activity Feeds**: Create chronological feeds of user activities and interactions
- **Follow/Unfollow**: Allow users to follow others and receive their updates
- **Event Posting**: Enable users to share updates, events, and statuses
- **Friend Recommendations**: Provide intelligent connection suggestions with privacy-preserving matching

Unlike traditional social networks, ContactsManager takes a privacy-first approach:

- Contact information stays on the user's device
- Neither your application nor our servers have access to raw contact data
- Users maintain full control over their connections at all times
- Military-grade encryption secures any data used in the matching process

## Requirements

- iOS 17.0+
- Swift 5.5+
- Xcode 13.0+

## Usage

Import the framework in your Swift file:

```swift
import ContactsManager
```
